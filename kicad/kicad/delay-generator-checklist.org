#+TITLE: CHECKLIST: KiCad delay generator project
* install KiCad
- kicad-pcb.org/download
* generate project
- this is a FOLDER
- contains .pro, .kicad_pcb, .sch
* set up schematic
- open eeschema
- file -> page settings -> USLetter
- title block parameters as desired
* populate schematic
- do not forget test points!
- assign component values
* assign footprints
- use "Edit Symbol Fields" table
* generate netlist
- annotate automatically
* set up PCB
- open PCBNEW
- file -> page settings -> USLetter
- title block parameters as desired
* create board outline
- useful during board layout
- good "typical" board size for small circuit: 2.5" by 4.5"
- (can expand board as needed)
- add mounting holes
* lay out board input and output points
- other things can be placed wherever, but the position of these is often fixed
