 material & cost & melting point & comment \\ \hline
ABS & $\$3.00 / \mathrm{in}^3$ & 220\textcelsius & self-service \\
 ASA & $\$3.50 / \mathrm{in}^3$ & 240\textcelsius & via UW Makerspace \\
 PLA & $\$2.00 / \mathrm{in}^3$  & 160\textcelsius & via UW Makerspace \\
 Nylon & ??? & 220\textcelsius & UW Makerspace. Scintillated.

To print via the UW Makerspace, contact Blaise Thompson.
A flat fee of $\$7$ will be added to the cost of material for any non self-service print.

\section{Self-Service Printing}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate STL file, units mm. Bring to control computer.
    \item Turn on 3D printer.
    \item Ensure build plate is clean and correctly installed.
    \item Open Catalyst EX.
    \item File, Open STL.
    \item Choose layer resolution, interior fill.
    \item Pack. Note sum of model + support material volume. Bill yourself out.
    \item Print.
    \item On printer, press ``start model''.
    \item Wait until printer actually begins printing (30 minutes).
    \item If long print, leave ``This eqipment being used'' card.
    \item You are responsible for picking up your print.
\end{enumerate}

\section{3D Printing Design Tips}

Press-fit 4-40 tapped holes.

Use hexagonal or tear-dropping holes.

Notes for training session.

\subsection{day before}

\subsubsection{print example parts}

Print something interesting, a part that the shop wants to try or similar.
The shop subsidizes the cost of this part, so it's an opportunity to try something.

\subsection{day of}

\subsubsection{3D printing options}

Overview 3D printing options.
Note commercial 3D printing is about the same cost as we are, including shipping.

\subsubsection{using the printer}

Start by unloading the printer.
The printer should be turned off (auto-shutdown) with the example print still on the bed.
Show the students the example print, on the bed.
Tell them how long the example print took, and how much money it would cost.
Remove the example print from the bed, and discuss base bath implications.

Continue by showing how to load and unload filament.

Finally, have each student load their parts to the printer.
Once the final student loads parts, start the printer.
Make sure to leave the printer on auto-shutdown.
Make sure to fill out a yellow card.

\subsubsection{design tips}

Consider using existing designs.

Software: inventor, meshmixer.

Overhang.

Fill density.

Wall thickness.

Resolution 10 thousands per layer typical. Hard to reach that resolution.

\subsection{day after}

Unload student-printed parts.
