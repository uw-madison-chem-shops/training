The mission of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is to conduct world-class, groundbreaking research in the chemical sciences while offering the highest quality of education to undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates. 
Our leadership in research includes the traditional areas of physical, analytical, inorganic, and organic chemistry, and has rapidly evolved to encompass environmental chemistry, chemical biology, biophysical chemistry, soft and hard materials chemistry, and nanotechnology. 
We pride ourselves on our highly interactive, diverse, and collegial scientific environment. 
Our emphasis on collaboration connects us to colleagues across campus, around the country, and throughout the world.
